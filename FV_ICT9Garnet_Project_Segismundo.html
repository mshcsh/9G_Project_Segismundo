				<td>Enforce a "No Smoking" rule both inside and outside the home</td>
				<td>One of the leading causes of fire-related fatalities is smoking and cigarette-related fires. These fires frequently start when cigarettes, ashes, or matches are inappropriately dumped and ignite mattresses, bedding, upholstered furniture, or rubbish. You can keep your home and family safe by being aware of what makes smoking fires so dangerous and what you can do to help prevent them.</td>

				<td>Unplug all electrical equipment when not in use</td>
				<td>You may be able to reduce your expenses by unplugging gadgets, and this action will also prolong the life of your possessions. The more things you have plugged in around the house, the more likely it is that a power surge or fire would cause damage.</td>

				<td>Keep flammable items out of children's reach and open heat</td>
